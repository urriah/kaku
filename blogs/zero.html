  <h1>How do I interact with Minecraft world using python?</h1>
    <p>The first hurdle I got was configuration for python and minecraft but with the help of this <a href="https://mrcote.info/blog/2024/06/10/how-to-get-started-with-learn-to-program-with-minecraft-in-2024/">https://mrcote.info/blog/2024/06/10/how-to-get-started-with-learn-to-program-with-minecraft-in-2024/</a>. I got it going as it was also easy to setup for arch linux. Yet I did spend some time from different resources that didn't work at all.</p>
